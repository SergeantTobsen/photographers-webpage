            <h3>Hi, I am Carla</h3>
            <p>born in the early â€˜90s. I am a minimalist and find pleasure in discomfort.</p>
            <p>I prefer doing things, instead of talking about them. </p>
            <p>I discovered photography while backpacking around the world and since then it has become a big part of my life.</p>
            <p>I quickly discovered that I was specifically drawn to photographing people and set a goal to open my own 
               portrait studio and in 2018 it has become a reality.</p>
